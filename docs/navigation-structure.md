## Step 1 - Setting up a Mongodb account 
{: .no_toc }


This set up will include setting up a Mongodb Atlas account and downloading it for local use. 

Head over to the Mongodb website at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/signup and register for an account. Once registered you will be redirect and prompted to pick a plan. There are 3 plans to choose from. For our purposes, a free account will be enough as it caters to small web applications.

At the starter cluster webpage, it will give you options to choose a cloud provider and a region. Choose AWS and a recommended region.

Make sure the cluster tier is checked under the free forever column in the M0 Sandbox row.

Once you enter a name and click create starter cluster, a new cluster will be created which will take around 1-2 minutes. 

By now, you will have set up an account and we will proceed with configuring the settings.
